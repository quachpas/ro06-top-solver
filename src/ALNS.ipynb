    "# Algorithm A: Local Search Improvement\n",
    "> [The algorithm] consists of popular inter-route and intraroute improvement methods. In the 1-1 improvement method, a stop from a route is exchanged with a stop from another route. The exchange is accepted if it is feasible for both routes and the total travel distance of the two routes is reduced. In the 1-0 improvement method, a stop from a route is moved into another route and improvement is tested. Similarly, the 2-1 improvement method exchanges two stops from a route with one stop from another route. The intra-route improvement algorithm consists of well-known 2opt edge exchange method and Or-opt improvement method (Or, 1976). The improvement methods repeat until no further improvement is possible."
