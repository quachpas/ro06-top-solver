The exchange is accepted if it is feasible for both routes and the total travel distance of the two routes is reduced. In the 1-0 improvement method, a stop from a route is moved into another route and improvement is tested. Similarly, the 2-1 improvement method exchanges two stops from a route with one stop from another route.
