  abstract = {The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) is the generalization to the case of multiple tours of the Orienteering Problem, known also as Selective Traveling Salesman Problem. A set of potential customers is available and a profit is collected from the visit to each customer. A fleet of vehicles is available to visit the customers, within a given time limit. The profit of a customer can be collected by one vehicle at most. The objective is to identify the customers which maximize the total collected profit while satisfying the given time limit for each vehicle. We propose two variants of a generalized tabu search algorithm and a variable neighborhood search algorithm for the solution of the TOP and show that each of these algorithms beats the already known heuristics.

  abstract = {Optimising routing of vehicles constitutes a major logistic stake in many industrial contexts. We are interested here in the optimal resolution of special cases of vehicle routing problems, known as team orienteering problems. In these problems, vehicles are guided by a reward that can be collected from customers, while the length of routes is limited. The main difference with classical vehicle routing problems is that not all customers have to be visited. The solution method we propose here is based on a Branch \& Price algorithm. It is, as far as we know, the first exact method proposed for such problems, except for a preliminary work from Gueguen (Methodes de r\'esolution exacte pour probl\'emes de tourn\'ees de v\'ehicules. Th\'ese de doctorat, \'ecole Centrale Paris 1999) and a work from Butt and Ryan (Comput Oper Res 26(4):427\textendash 441 1999). It permits to solve instances with up to 100 customers.},

  abstract = {The Multiple Tour Maximum Collection Problem (MTMCP) is closely related to the classical Traveling Salesman and Vehicle Routing Problems. One major difference with the MTMCP is that it is not possible to visit all of the nodes in the graph in the total time allocated on a given set of tours. However, with the MTMCP, a reward is collected from each node that is visited. The objective of the MTMCP is to determine which nodes to visit on m time-constrained tours for which the total reward collected is maximized. It is assumed that each tour begins and ends at a central depot and that each node can be visited no more than one time, on at most one tour. In this paper, an optimal solution procedure is presented for the MTMCP. This procedure is based on a set-partitioning formulation and makes efficient use of both column generation and constraint branching. Numerical results are presented which show that this optimal procedure can be used to solve problems of realistic size in a reasonable amount of time. Scope and purpose A common assumption of many vehicle routing and scheduling problems is that each customer is to be visited exactly once, on exactly one route (tour). In this paper, we consider a problem where this is not possible. We assume that the routes are constrained in such a way that all of the customers cannot be visited. For example, suppose that we have five 8hour days to visit customers, but too many customers to visit in this amount of time. In problems where it is possible to visit all customers, the typical objective is to determine the minimum amount of time (or distance) needed to make all of the visits. Conversely, if all of the customers cannot be visited, the main objective is to determine the optimal subset of customers to visit in the time allotted. In this paper we assume that there is a reward which is collected when visiting a customer, and that the problem objective is to maximize the total reward collected.},

  abstract = {In the famous classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a fleet of vehicles services a set of customers from a distribution depot to deliver or collect products. Each vehicle has a fixed capacity which cannot be exceeded and each customer has a known demand that must be fully satisfied. The objective is to provide each vehicle with a sequence of deliveries so that all customers are serviced and the total distance traveled by the fleet (or the total travel cost incurred by the fleet) is minimized without violating some other specified constraints. The Multi-level Vehicle Routing Problems (MLVRP) addressed in this dissertation contain at least two levels of decision making optimization in which the VRP is a specific level or a variant. However, the lowest level of the MLVRP is always a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or a TSP-variant. The TSP is an NP-hard optimization problem, so the MLVRP's are at least as difficult as the TSP. For a large scale MLVRP, an exact method will be hard to get an optimal solution to the problem in a limited real world computation time. In the real world application, a heuristic method that can get a near optimal solution to the problem by using a reasonable computation time is preferred and practical. In this dissertation, five prototypes of the MLVRP are addressed. They are the orienteering problem, the team orienteering problem, the multi-depot vehicle routing problem, the period vehicle routing, and the period traveling salesman problem. For each type of problem, an effective heuristic method based upon a same simple basic idea is developed. The basic idea is that the algorithms accept some worse solutions when the searching procedure continues. When we make a decision of transitting a solution to another one, a set of candidates are considered one after one. Whenever a candidate can improve the objective function value, it is performed right away and all others are ignored. When no candidate can improve the objective function value, then one that losses the objective function value at the least will be performed if the amount of lossing value is not too many. The heuristics are implemented on the bench mark test problems taken from the literatures and the results are compared to those published along with the existing methods. A varieties of new test problems are also generated for each type of addressed MLVRP and are solved by the newly developed heuristics and by a new code of an existing methods or a carefully inspection. The comparisons for both sets of test problems for all five types of MLVRP show the superiority of the new heuristics. Finally, we synthesize the heuristics developed in this dissertation as a new general heuristic method for solving the MLVRP related optimization problems.},

In the case of the simple Orienteering Problem (OP), a single route connecting all selected locations should be followed; in TOP m routes are required and the length of each route is restricted to Tmax.

This solution is obtained by the use of either of two algorithms based on approximate methods. The two algorithms are given, and their efficiency is tested on a number of illustrative problems. Finally, a comparison between the two forms of the sport of orienteering is made.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present an overview of metaheuristics used in tourism and to introduce Skewed VNS to solve the team orienteering problem (TOP). Selecting the most interesting points of interest and designing a personalised tourist trip, can be modelled as a TOP with time windows (TOPTW). Guided local search (GLS) and variable neighbourhood search (VNS) are applied to efficiently solve the TOP. Iterated local search (ILS) is implemented to solve the TOPTW. The GLS and VNS algorithms are compared with the best known heuristics and applied on large problem sets. The obtained results are almost of the same quality as the results of these heuristics but the computational time is reduced significantly. For some of the problems VNS calculates new best solutions. The results of the ILS algorithm, applied to large problem sets, have an average gap with the optimal solution of only 2.7\%, with much less computational effort.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, a number of challenging applications in logistics, tourism and other fields were modelled as orienteering problems (OP). In the orienteering problem, a set of vertices is given, each with a score. The goal is to determine a path, limited in length, that visits some vertices and maximises the sum of the collected scores. In this paper, the literature about the orienteering problem and its applications is reviewed. The OP is formally described and many relevant variants are presented. All published exact solution approaches and (meta) heuristics are discussed and compared. Interesting open research questions concerning the OP conclude this paper.},

  abstract = {In the team orienteering problem (TOP) a set of locations is given, each with a score. The goal is to determine a fixed number of routes, limited in length, that visit some locations and maximise the sum of the collected scores. This paper describes an algorithm that combines different local search heuristics to solve the TOP. Guided local search (GLS) is used to improve two of the proposed heuristics. An extra heuristic is added to regularly diversify the search in order to explore more areas of the solution space. The algorithm is compared with the best known heuristics of the literature and applied on a large problem set. The obtained results are almost of the same quality as the results of these heuristics but the computational time is reduced significantly. Applying GLS to solve the TOP appears to be a very promising technique. Furthermore, the usefulness of exploring more areas of the solution space is clearly demonstrated.},
