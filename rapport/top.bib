  abstract = {Optimising routing of vehicles constitutes a major logistic stake in many industrial contexts. We are interested here in the optimal resolution of special cases of vehicle routing problems, known as team orienteering problems. In these problems, vehicles are guided by a reward that can be collected from customers, while the length of routes is limited. The main difference with classical vehicle routing problems is that not all customers have to be visited. The solution method we propose here is based on a Branch \& Price algorithm. It is, as far as we know, the first exact method proposed for such problems, except for a preliminary work from Gueguen (Methodes de r\'esolution exacte pour probl\'emes de tourn\'ees de v\'ehicules. Th\'ese de doctorat, \'ecole Centrale Paris 1999) and a work from Butt and Ryan (Comput Oper Res 26(4):427\textendash 441 1999). It permits to solve instances with up to 100 customers.},

  abstract = {The Multiple Tour Maximum Collection Problem (MTMCP) is closely related to the classical Traveling Salesman and Vehicle Routing Problems. One major difference with the MTMCP is that it is not possible to visit all of the nodes in the graph in the total time allocated on a given set of tours. However, with the MTMCP, a reward is collected from each node that is visited. The objective of the MTMCP is to determine which nodes to visit on m time-constrained tours for which the total reward collected is maximized. It is assumed that each tour begins and ends at a central depot and that each node can be visited no more than one time, on at most one tour. In this paper, an optimal solution procedure is presented for the MTMCP. This procedure is based on a set-partitioning formulation and makes efficient use of both column generation and constraint branching. Numerical results are presented which show that this optimal procedure can be used to solve problems of realistic size in a reasonable amount of time. Scope and purpose A common assumption of many vehicle routing and scheduling problems is that each customer is to be visited exactly once, on exactly one route (tour). In this paper, we consider a problem where this is not possible. We assume that the routes are constrained in such a way that all of the customers cannot be visited. For example, suppose that we have five 8hour days to visit customers, but too many customers to visit in this amount of time. In problems where it is possible to visit all customers, the typical objective is to determine the minimum amount of time (or distance) needed to make all of the visits. Conversely, if all of the customers cannot be visited, the main objective is to determine the optimal subset of customers to visit in the time allotted. In this paper we assume that there is a reward which is collected when visiting a customer, and that the problem objective is to maximize the total reward collected.},

  abstract = {In the famous classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a fleet of vehicles services a set of customers from a distribution depot to deliver or collect products. Each vehicle has a fixed capacity which cannot be exceeded and each customer has a known demand that must be fully satisfied. The objective is to provide each vehicle with a sequence of deliveries so that all customers are serviced and the total distance traveled by the fleet (or the total travel cost incurred by the fleet) is minimized without violating some other specified constraints. The Multi-level Vehicle Routing Problems (MLVRP) addressed in this dissertation contain at least two levels of decision making optimization in which the VRP is a specific level or a variant. However, the lowest level of the MLVRP is always a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or a TSP-variant. The TSP is an NP-hard optimization problem, so the MLVRP's are at least as difficult as the TSP. For a large scale MLVRP, an exact method will be hard to get an optimal solution to the problem in a limited real world computation time. In the real world application, a heuristic method that can get a near optimal solution to the problem by using a reasonable computation time is preferred and practical. In this dissertation, five prototypes of the MLVRP are addressed. They are the orienteering problem, the team orienteering problem, the multi-depot vehicle routing problem, the period vehicle routing, and the period traveling salesman problem. For each type of problem, an effective heuristic method based upon a same simple basic idea is developed. The basic idea is that the algorithms accept some worse solutions when the searching procedure continues. When we make a decision of transitting a solution to another one, a set of candidates are considered one after one. Whenever a candidate can improve the objective function value, it is performed right away and all others are ignored. When no candidate can improve the objective function value, then one that losses the objective function value at the least will be performed if the amount of lossing value is not too many. The heuristics are implemented on the bench mark test problems taken from the literatures and the results are compared to those published along with the existing methods. A varieties of new test problems are also generated for each type of addressed MLVRP and are solved by the newly developed heuristics and by a new code of an existing methods or a carefully inspection. The comparisons for both sets of test problems for all five types of MLVRP show the superiority of the new heuristics. Finally, we synthesize the heuristics developed in this dissertation as a new general heuristic method for solving the MLVRP related optimization problems.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP). TOP is a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in which the aim is to maximize the total amount of collected profits from visiting customers while not exceeding the predefined travel time limit of each vehicle. In contrast to the exact solving methods in the literature, our algorithm is based on a linear formulation with a polynomial number of binary variables. The algorithm features a new set of useful dominance properties and valid inequalities. The set includes symmetric breaking inequalities, boundaries on pro fits, generalized subtour eliminations and clique cuts from graphs of incompatibilities. Experiments conducted on the standard benchmark for TOP clearly show that our branch-and-cut is competitive with the other methods in the literature and allows us to close 29 open instances.},

A `good', if not `optimal' solution of the corresponding problem by means of an efficient and computationally feasible method is derived and discussed. This solution is obtained by the use of either of two algorithms based on approximate methods. The two algorithms are given, and their efficiency is tested on a number of illustrative problems.
