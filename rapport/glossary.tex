name={structural causal model},
description={
Let $\boldsymbol{X}$ be a finite collection of random
variables. A Structural Causal Model $\mathcal{C}
	\coloneq(\boldsymbol{S}, P_N)$ consists of a collection $S$ of
$d$ structural assignments with the form
$X_i\coloneq f_i(\mathbf{PA}_i, N_i),\quad j=1,\dots,d$.
$\mathbf{PA}_i\subseteq\left\{X_1,\dots,X_d\right\} \setminus
	\left\{X_i\right\}$ is the set of the parents of $X_i$.
$P_N=P_{N_1,\dots,N_d}$ is a joint distribution over the
jointly independent noise variables $N_i,i=1,\dots,d$. The
associated directed graph of an SCM is obtained by creating one
node for each variable $X_i$, and a directed edge from each
parent in $\mathbf{PA}_i$ to $X_i$.
The graph is usually assumed to be acyclic
